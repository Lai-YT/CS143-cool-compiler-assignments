# Programming Assignments in Stanford CS143

Programming assignments II–V will direct you to design and build a compiler for *Cool*. Each assignment
will cover one component of the compiler: lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.
Each assignment will ultimately result in a working compiler phase which can interface with other phases.

> Java related materials are removed. I'll be using C++.
