# Programming Assignments in Stanford CS143

Programming assignments II–V will direct you to design and build a compiler for *Cool*. Each assignment
will cover one component of the compiler: lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.
Each assignment will ultimately result in a working compiler phase which can interface with other phases.

> Java related materials are removed. I'll be using C++.

| PA  | brief  | status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| [PA1](handouts/PA1.pdf) | acquaint with the *Cool* language | [done](assignments/PA1/) |
| [PA2](handouts/PA2.pdf) | lexical analyzer with *Flex* | [done](assignments/PA2/) |
| [PA3](handouts/PA3.pdf) | parser with *Bison* | [test passed](assignments/PA3/)* |
| [PA4](handouts/PA4.pdf) |        | to do |
| [PA5](handouts/PA5.pdf) |        | to do |

*Some of the tests failed. But this is likely because the reference parser doesn't generate correct line numbers on attributes.
